<p> I was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 2001, but moved to Boston when I was six months old.
<br> My major is Magazine and Digital Journalism and I am applying to be an iSchool Dual.
<br> During quarantine, my friend Catie (she's also in IST 195!) and I created a graphic design business and are selling custom edits to our peers on Redbubble </p>
